# Travel-Aggregator-Analysis
In this project/case study I created during my internship at Edureka, I created an aggregator -'MyNextBooking'-on top of available platforms. It  helps  the  user  compare  prices  for  their  upcoming journies  on  its  platform  and  the  customer  is  redirected  to  the  desired  platform  after looking at the price. 
Using Python, I performed the following tasks:
1)Find thenumber of distinct bookings,sessions,and searches from the given datasets.
2)How many sessions have more than one booking?
3)Which days of the week have the highest number of bookings?Also,draw a piechart to show the distribution for all days of the week?
4)For each of the servicenames,display the total number of bookings and the total GrossBookingValue in INR.
5)For customers who have more than 1 booking,which is the most booked route(from_city to to_city)?
6)Which are the top 3 departure cities from where customers book mostly in advance,provided that there have been atleast 5 departures from that city?
7)Plot a heatmap displaying correlations of the numerical column and report which pair of numerical columns in the bookings dataset,have the maximum correlation?
8)For each service,which is the most used device type for making bookings on the platform?
9)Plot the trends at a quarterly frequency for the number of bookings by each of the device types, that is, plot a time series for each year and quarter showing thenumberofbookingsperformed by each device type.
10)Consider the following example:
12 customers performed a total of 100 searches but only a few of them performed 10 bookings in total.
Searches= 100 ,bookings =10,customers= 12
The overall booking to search ratio,Ober,is 10/100=0.1 Using the above information/context,answer the following:
•What is the average oBSR for each month of the year?
•What is the average oBSR for each day of the week?
•Plot a timeseries of oBSR on all the given dates.
